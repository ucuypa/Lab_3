        I'm still exploring what I truly want to pursue in my campus life. There are so many opportunities to dive into, from academic projects to extracurriculars that could shape my skills and interests. I'm currently navigating through various areas, like programming, communication, and even hands-on projects that could tie in with my passion for mechanics. Balancing these diverse interests with new hobbies like photography and gaming keeps things exciting, and I'm gradually discovering what resonates with me. This exploration phase feels like a journey to uncover where I can grow the most and make a meaningful impact during my college years.
